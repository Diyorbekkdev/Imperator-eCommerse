# Milandi E-commerce Website

This is the repository for the Milandi e-commerce website developed by the CodeBreakers team, led by Diyorbek. The website was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, following the 7-1 SCSS structure for styling and leveraging JavaScript's DOM manipulation for dynamic interactivity.

## Project Structure

The project follows the 7-1 pattern for organizing SCSS files. The structure includes the following directories:

- `base/` - Contains foundational styles such as typography, colors, and resets.
- `components/` - Includes reusable UI components like buttons, cards, and forms.
- `layout/` - Deals with the overall layout structure of the website.
- `pages/` - Contains specific styles for different pages of the website.
- `themes/` - Manages different themes and styles for customization.
- `utils/` - Houses utility classes and helper functions.
- `vendors/` - Includes external libraries or third-party stylesheets.

## JavaScript Implementation

The website incorporates JavaScript to enhance interactivity and user experience. DOM manipulation techniques are utilized to dynamically update and manipulate website content based on user actions.
